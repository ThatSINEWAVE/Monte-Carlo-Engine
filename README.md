Monte Carlo Engine is a web-based simulation tool that leverages the Monte Carlo method to generate probabilistic outcomes based on user-defined parameters. It allows users to input variables, set ranges and weights, and run randomized simulations to analyze probability distributions and interactions.
 
**Live Demo:** [Monte Carlo Engine](https://thatsinewave.github.io/Monte-Carlo-Engine)

## Features

- **Dynamic Parameter Input** – Define multiple parameters with adjustable min/max values and weights.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** – Runs thousands of randomized trials to generate outcome distributions.
- **Probability Analysis** – Displays top outcomes with probability percentages.
- **Interaction Effects** – Simulates parameter dependencies and influences.
- **Visualizations** – Interactive bar charts and pie charts for insights.
- **Customizable Iterations** – Choose simulation intensity for accuracy vs. speed.

## Installation & Usage

The Monte Carlo Engine is a browser-based tool, and no installation is required. Simply visit the [live demo](https://thatsinewave.github.io/Monte-Carlo-Engine) or clone the repository for local use.

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thatsinewave/Monte-Carlo-Engine.git
   cd Monte-Carlo-Engine
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## How It Works

1. Add parameters (name, range, weight).
2. Set the number of iterations (higher = more accuracy).
3. Run the simulation.
4. View probability distributions and parameter influences.
